# GTODocTest

## Markdown Documentation / Wiki Test

This is the product help and documentation in GFM (Github Flavoured Markdown) for the Canterbury Gliding Club instance of GlideTime Online (GTO) <https://canterburyglidingclub.nz/gto>.  The help pages are published at <https://gto.walls.net.nz:4443/gtodocs/>.


Styling is acheived with the _Template.html, style.css and the "attr_list" extension when the markdown content is converted to HTML.

Contact Neil at nallison@ieee.org or neil@avon-tech-solutions.co.nz with any comments, suggestions or if you'd like to contribute.
