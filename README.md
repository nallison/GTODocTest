# GTODocTest
Markdown Documentation / Wiki Test

This is a repo to test writing product help and documentation in GFM (Github Flavoured Markdown).  It automagically generates web help pages at https://nallison.github.io/GTODocTest/ from the 'main' branch.

A placeholder Wiki for this repo has also been set up at: https://github.com/nallison/GTODocTest/wiki
