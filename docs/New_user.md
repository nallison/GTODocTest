# Getting Login Credentials
GTO is an online database and we need everybody to have individual accounts.  To get started please email the GTO webmaster <awalls@walls.net.nz> and send three pieces of information:

1. Your name.

1. The email you want for your account.

1. The three letter Billing Code you would like.

Once your account has been set up, GTO will email you a password to get you started. You can set your own password later if you want.

## About Three Letter Billing Codes
GTO uses a three letter billing code for pilots. Much like PB, CC and MQ identify club gliders, everybody will have a **unique** personal three letter billing code. Choose any three letters you like (as long as they haven't been used already). For example, Alan's middle name is "James" so he's using AJW. No prizes for guessing who KEV, WAL and ICE are assigned to.

# First Login
Once your account is setup you can login and you will arrive at the Main page:

Your first job is to login and update your personal account details. Click the link in your three letter billing code in the top right corner of the screen.  Now you can update various contact details:

If you own a private glider please update your glider details. From the Main page, open the "REPORTS & ADMIN" panel at the bottom and click "Manage Gliders".
