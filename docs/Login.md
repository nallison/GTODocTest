# About Logins

GTO is an online database of your club flying and training and we need everybody to have individual accounts. Individual accounts allow GTO to keep information private where appropriate.

## Login Page

This is the web page you land on: you need to enter your credentials for either Member login or Duty login

## GTO Automatic Duty login

Selected computers can be configured to allow GTO to not require account details for Duty login.  This feature is designed to provide automatic login for shared computers, physically located at the airfield, such as the laptop used for Ops control in the Kraak Kontrol building. You will not need to enter your personal account details to login for Duty Pilot.

The screen shows the message that "Automatic Duty login has been enabled for this computer."
