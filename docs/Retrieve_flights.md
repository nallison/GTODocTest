# How to handle a glider retrieve in GTO.

Technically, a retrieve sequence could be three GTO flights

1. Original glider launch
1. Towplane relocation to outland airstrip
1. Retrieve launch and return.

The towplane has launched/landed three times.  The glider has launched/landed twice.

However, entering all three flights into GTO would be painful and unnecessary.  Instead we enter a retrieve sequence as two flights in GTO.

1. Original glider flight
    - billed as normal
    - Note: hard for Kraak Kontrol to enter glider landing time.
1. Retrieve flight.
    - Towplane and glider details are entered.
    - bill towplane tach hours.
    - glider times charged as normal.
    - Adjust times as necessary to reflect glider flight time.
    - Note : hard for Kraak Kontrol to enter launch times.


## How will GTO be handled...

- Enter the original flight and launch.
- Glider lands out and asks springfield base for a retrieve.
- Land original glider flight.  Setting landout time if known.
- Create a new GTO retrieve flight detailing glider and towplane as usual.
- Launch retrieve flight when towplane launches.
- Land towplane when it gets back to springfield.
- Land glider when it gets back to springfield.
- Enter towplane Tach time to retrieve flight.
- Adjust retrieve launch time to glider relight time.  This will give gto the true glider flight hours.
