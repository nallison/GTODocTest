# History

GlideTime Online has been developed from a system that Alan Walls developed for a gliding club in Colorado.  He has adapted it for use with Canterbury Gliding Club and added new features and reports to support "our way of doing" club gliding.

GTO replaces the original glideTime application written by Rob Sherlock in the Python language from about 2009 as a replacement for the often incomplete, and sometimes illegible, paper time sheets.  Back in those days we did not have internet at the airfield and reports were manually transferred with a USB flash drive.  glideTime evolved to do our time keeping, flight following and produce various reports for the club and pilots including emailing session reports once the internet was available at Springfield.  The main limitation is that glideTime is an application run on one laptop in Kraak Kontrol and it cannot be operated remotely.  A decade and a half later we have mobile internet on our phones and the means to provide a web-based and online tool.

GTO has imported the glideTime flight records from about 2012: this allows us to use GTO to run historical reports.  This old dataset is not perfect so remember the adage "Garbage In, Garbage Out" when using the older data.
