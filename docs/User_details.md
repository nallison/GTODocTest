# Updating Your Details

Once you have logged in, you can review your activity, training notes and update many of your details by clicking your billing code in the top right corner of the screen, or anywhere else it appears such as in flight records.

Next, click the **Edit** button in the lower right hand corner and the Edit screen appears.

Your activity for the **Last 90 Days** and  **Training** notes and goals are presented in the sections near the bottom of the page.

## Adding a photo

You are able to upload a photo or image to replace the default one.  Ideally this would be a "head and shoulders" or passport style photo so other members can identify you, especially if they've not met you before.

## Your Details and Contact Information

## Admin and Instructor Fields

Please email an admin or the webmaster to update those fields that you cannot edit, for example Membership and Billing types.
