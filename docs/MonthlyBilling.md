# About Monthly Billing

Monthly billing is only available to admin accounts.  This function creates the monthly billing data files our club accountant needs to generate invoices.  Typically this process is run shortly after the month end but it can be run any time, including before month end.

Click the Monthly Billing button in the main screen Reports & Admin panel.

## Three Step Process

Billing is a three step process designed to ensure every flight is billed only once.

### Flight Tagging
Flight tagging attaches flights to a specific billing period.  Once a flight is tagged it is permanently attached to that billing period.  Tagged flights are locked and cannot be changed except my administators.  Members will still be able to view this flight data, it just cannot be edited.

When checking for taggable flight GTO matches all untagged flights on or before the billing period date that are not future reservations.  This rule allows billing runs to be created before the month end while still ensuring all flights are billed.   

### Validation
Press "next" after tagging to see an initial billing report.  Look over the list to find any incomplete flights. These flights will not be billed correctly.  The flight data needs to be corrected and saved.

Note: Validation can also be done prior to tagging.

### Accounting File Creation
Once all flights are correct the download links for .csv and .pdf files will appear.  You are now ready to generate the accounting files.  Click the csv and/or pdf links in the Billing panel to download the required files to give to the club accountant.
