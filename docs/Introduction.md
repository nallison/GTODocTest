# What is GlideTime Online?
GlideTime Online (GTO) is a multi-user, web-based application that records glider flights and provides flight following, costing, engineering and logbook outputs for club officers and individual pilots.

Two primary objectives for the Canterbury Gliding Club instance are to: 
1. Increase glider flying hours
1. Improve flight reporting and statistics to help drive better decision making
